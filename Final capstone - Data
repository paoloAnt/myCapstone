Regarding the data on the activities of the cities I will use the API of Foursquare within the geocoder Nominatim. While for the economic aspect the data will be taken from the site of the 'Sole 24 ore', the most important Italian economic newspaper. This is the reference link: https://lab24.ilsole24ore.com/mappaRedditi/redditiTabelle.html
